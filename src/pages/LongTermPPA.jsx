          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is a Long-Term PPA?</h3>
          <p>
            A Long-Term PPA is a contractual agreement between a power generator
            and a buyer (corporate, utility, or government) to supply electricity
            over an extended periodâ€”typically 10 to 25 years. These agreements
            are vital for securing project financing, managing energy costs, and
            achieving long-term sustainability targets.
